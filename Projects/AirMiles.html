    </blockquote>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">I joined the AIR MILES Business Transformation team, reporting to the AD of User Experience, and also got to work closely with the User Research team. I was curious to see how the team here designed their AIR MILES product portfolio to cater to 11 million collectors, in an increasingly competitive loyalty market.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="subheader">The Challenge(s)</h2>
    <p class="flow-text"> Since my team was under shared services, I was able to work on a variety of different projects. I learned a lot about the different design and research processes available, and when it was appropriate to use each process. In terms of products, I got to conceptualize a new Chat Landing page, in place of the <a href="https://www.airmiles.ca/arrow/ChatLandingOpenPage">outdated</a> one. I also got to coneptualize the redesign for CELO Green, the software used on every call by our customer agents.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">Under the UX Research team, I had the oppurtunity to recruit, moderate, and conduct, user research sessions with both internal stakeholders, as well as our collectors. We looked at oppurtunities to improve the Offers workstream, and offer collectors a better onmi-channel experience. I helped with the user research and synthesis for our national promotion, <a href="https://shoptheblock.ca">Shop the Block</a>, looking for oppurtunities to improve the mobile and desktop micro-site experience.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">As a side project I designed this funky poster, to help guide our internal stakeholders during user testing viewing sessions:</p>

    <div class="small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Chat Landing Page</h2>
    <p class="flow-text"> The current Chat Landing page needed an overhaul. Not only was it outdated, but with a change in one of our redemption processes, the page had to redirect users to our vendor's support page to complete a certain type of redemption. The high level goals were to:</p>


    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Direct users to the correct vendor support pages.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Promote use of self-serve options before starting a live chat/call.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Not hinder or make it difficult for users to start a live chat.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Follow the current AIR MILES pattern library and branding guidelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <center><img class="responsive-img" src="../img/old-chat-landing.PNG" style="width: 750px;"></center>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Research and Ideation</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">A majority of tickets to our call centre are PIN resets, card replacements, and email changes. All of these issues can be resolved fairly quickly with our self-serve tool. Though the chat page currently has links to the tool, it is hidden behind a mouse scrollover, and also doesn't prompt with relevant and highly visible FAQs. These tools should be easily accessible to proactively solve our collectors' issues, prior to them needing to open a chat. Since we released <a href="https://m.me/AirmilesMyles" target="_blank">Myles the FAQ Chatbot</a> earlier this year, it would be ideal to introduce this feature to our collectors on this page as well. Myles can help guide them through their self-serve journey, or steer them towards knowledge articles, without the hassle of a chat or call.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">Another feature to consider is the call-to-action button that opens the chat. There are currently six "Chat Now" CTA buttons, which might overwelm someone looking to just change their PIN. This goes hand-in-hand with the wording of the self-serve copy as well. Phrases like “How do I …” that don’t relate to the specific task, makes it more fustrating to scan for the one solution relevant to them. By eliminating jargon, simplifying the layout, and improving readability, these changes can guide collectors to the channel that they determine will suit them best.</p>

    <h3 class="subheader">High Fidelity</h3>
    <p class="flow-text"> Our client came to us with a rather broad problem. Through research, it was determined that people who travel also want to meet new people, but currently 58% of people reported as 'unhappy' or 'satisfactory' with their ability to 'spontaneously meet new people'.</p>
