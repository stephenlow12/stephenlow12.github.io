    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">FoodPrint, is a gamified tracking app that helps users reach their environmental goals around sustainable food consumption. This project was a submission for the Fall 2017 Shopify Design Challenge, completed over a span of four hours.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="subheader">The Challenge</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">With the growing effects of climate change, this challenge approached the problem of how we could better understand our direct impact to the environment, from simply the choices we make everyday. The problem was rather broad and ambiguous leaving us much room for interpretation and creativity. The only requirements that the challenge prompted for was that the digital product must:</p>

    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Make it easy for someone to log their information every day.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Assess their progress in a way that helps them understand their impact.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Encourage daily use, while keeping the user interested over a long term.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Inspiration</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">My two main inspirations were apps that I have used in the past, MyFitnessPal and Carrot Rewards. Both apps track user inputs, such as food consumption and steps, and provides an incentive to keep the user motivated. They also have an aspect of gamification, with MyFitnessPal using your own measurements and progress, while Carrot Rewards uses a currency system that you can transfer to your favourite loyalty program. To get the users to continuously use their platforms, both apps offer daily incentives. Similarly, users in FoodPrint are sent daily challenges and quizzes so that when completed, nets them points added to their total FoodPrint score.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Opportunity</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">Footprint lets users set goals (such as wanting to reduce their carbon footprint by twice the amount), which, when combined with the user’s profile, will generate personalized challenges and tips based on the food they consume. For example, if you put in that you have eaten a lot of ground beef, it will quiz you about the large environmental footprint of cattle farms. This app is targeted towards people that want to be more environmentally conscious about their daily choices when it comes to eating. I wanted to help show transparency in the food system by informing the true costs of our meals. In a “tragedy of the commons”, individual incentives far outweighed collective concerns and action. If we are more informed about the effects of our food purchase decisions, that is one step closer to a cleaner world.</p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <div class="row">

      <div class="col s12 m12 l3 section">

      <h4 style="font-weight: 500;">Home</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">As a motivation to encourage frequent usage, the home page has a daily feed of activities, tips, and quizzes that are curated to educate the user. This activity feed is also generated through analyzing the users meals that they have added into the app.</p>

      </div>
      <img src="../img/Challenges.png" class="col s12 m12 l3" style="padding:1.5% !important">

      <div class="col s12 m12 l3 section">
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;">Profile</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">Each user has their own profile which displays their stats such as, streak, following, and score. Users can challenge their friends and compete for more weekly points. The Leaderboards helps motivate users to actively engage with the app.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col s12 m12 l3 section">
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;">Tracker</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">The Tracker page gives you access to your global FoodPrint score, an aggravated score that determines your sustainable food consumption. You can also access your daily, weekly, and monthly stats, and filter down your history to monitor your progress to date.</p>
      </div>

      <img src="../img/Track.png" class="col s12 m12 l3" style="padding:1.5% !important">

      <div class="col s12 m12 l3 section">
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;">Rewards</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">One of the most satisfying actions in gamification is redeeming your points. Your FoodPrint score gives you access to exclusive partner (who are just as environmentally conscious) content and perks. The higher your score, the more you unlock.</p>

      <img src="../img/Rewards.png" class="col s12 m12 l3" style="padding:1.5% !important">

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col s12 m12 l3 section">
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;">Add Food</h4>
        <p class="flow-text"> The bread and butter. The Add Food page allows the user to easily log the food they've eaten that day, either through a manual search, or scanning the barcode. The search is matched with the food database to determine in realtime, 'how much has this meal contributed to my FoodPrint?'.</p>

    <div class="small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Key Learnings</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">One of my major goals for this project was for the users to use it enough so that they become well-informed about sustainable food consumption. Initially, I wanted the app to act simply as a guidance and a tracker. The challenge of getting the users to return back to the app, led me to explore the popular tool of gamification. The appropriate use of gamification can lend a huge hand for UX designers, as if used correctly, can greatly influence both user engagement and conversion rates.</p>
