    <p class="flow-text">The SXD Lab is an Ontario innovation hub that tackles some of the most complex problems facing post-secondary education. I'm currently working on the Northern and Remote project stream, to reimagine how to better prepare Northern and remote learners for online learning.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="subheader">Background</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">The Northern and Remote project is looking to enhance the post-secondary educational journey for northern and remote online learners. Students who choose to study online are faced with unique academic challenges that they often have to overcome on an individual basis. The Northern and Remote team was tasked with combatting one of the common learning barriers faced by online learners and provide an innovative solution that can help guide students towards achieving their academic goals. Using inclusive design processes, the solution will aim to create value in tools designed for academic success and encourage collaboration amongst peers.
    </p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Challenge</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Research conducted by the Northern and Remote team during the initial design phase has identified the demographic of online and remote learners across Ontario. With 12,728 online courses, 809 online programs, and 360,000 students, 29% of all postsecondary students in Ontario are online learners. 

      Through our user research, we found that online learners are commonly female, middle aged, and have families. Despite being remote to their respective universities and colleges, their responsibilities, be it work or family, also keep them at home. Online learning provides these individuals with the opportunity to reach their academic goals, and allows them the flexibility needed for their busy lives. Based on our findings, there is an opportunity to optimize and streamline the academic resources available to online learners, and provide chances for structured collaboration between peers.

      <p class="flow-text">Based off of initial interviews with our stakeholders, we were able to craft personas for them:</p>

      <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>        

    <h2 class="subheader">Journey Mapping</h2>

      <p class="flow-text">We journey mapped our stakeholders to identify touchpoints and opportunities:</p>

      <div class="small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Ideation</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">From our journey maps, we crafted a list of features that the cart must, should, and could have. For our initial ideation, we focused on extendable, large, table spaces to better facilitate sessions for larger groups. This however would not only increase the size and weight of the cart, but also block access to storage space.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">After user testing our initial prototype with our stakeholders, we were able to conclude the following about our initial ideation:</p>

    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Environmental considerations needed to operate large table surfaces.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Adjustable surfaces to better suit a variety of environments.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Large storage areas could have potential for future prototypes.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Discretion of dual-use table and whiteboard/display, in the event of simultaneously usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>   

    <h2 class="subheader">Prototyping</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">After a second round of feedback from our stakeholders, we were able to finalize our product and start the physical 1:1 scaled prototype.</p>

    <center><img class="responsive-img" src="../img/final-cart.png" style="width: 1500px;"></center>

    <div class="small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Current State</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">We are currently working on a prototype to fuel collaboration amongst online learners, enabling them to share resources, experiences, and other pertinent knowledge. While some students seek an individual educational journey, others wish they had better communication with their school and peers. Our prototype tool will increase the students’ knowledge of academic resources, help them to establish peer networks, and give them the ability to take charge of their own success and feel confident about their education.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">The Lab</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">The <a href="https://sxdlab.ecampusontario.ca/">SXD Lab</a> is a student innovation lab tasked with solving complex post-secondary problems using design methodologies. The problems and opportunities that we focus on are often wrapped up in a system that requires a lot of unpacking, user research, and a variety of interventions. The goal of the projects is to create change – in the way the system operates, and the way it works with students.</p>
