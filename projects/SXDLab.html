                    <h3>Background</h3>
                   
                    <p class="flow-text">The Northern and Remote project looked at enhancing the post-secondary educational journey for northern and remote online learners. Students who choose to study online are faced with unique academic challenges that they often have to overcome on an individual basis. Using inclusive design processes, we aimed at creating value in a tool designed for academic success and encourage collaboration amongst peers.</p>

					<div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

                    <h3>1/3 of All Students Are Online</h3>
                    <p class="flow-text">Research conducted by the cohort prior identified the demographic of online and remote learners across Ontario. They found that there were 12,728 online courses, 809 online programs, and 360,000 online students, which makes up 29% of all postsecondary students in Ontario.</p>

      				<p class="flow-text">Despite being remote to their respective universities and colleges, their responsibilities, be it work or family, also kept them at home. There was an opportunity to optimize and streamline the academic resources available to online learners, and provide chances for structured collaboration between peers.</p>
                
                </div>
                
                <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

                <h3>Province-Wide Interviews With Students</h3>

                <center><img class="responsive-img" src="../img/ontario-map.png" style="width: 1000px;"></center>
                <p class="center-align">Map showing locations of interview participants</p>

                <p class="flow-text">To understand the root problems and challenges online and remote learners faced, we conducted discovery research through structured one-on-one interviews with current online or remote students. We targeted our recruitment towards students from northern and remote communities in Ontario.</p>
            </div>

                <center><img class="responsive-img" src="../img/journey-map-sxd.PNG" style="width: 1000px;"></center>
                <p class="center-align">Example of a journey map that laid out the participants first year of online learning</p>

                <p class="flow-text">Through a dozen remote interviews and journey mapping exercises, we were able to identify a few common themes. As an aide for our research, we also surveyed over 50 online and remote students to gather quantitative data to further support our interview findings.</p>

                <center><img class="responsive-img" src="../img/grouping-sxd.jpg" style="width: 1000px;"></center>
                <p class="center-align">Infinity mapping and grouping our findings into themes</p>

                <p class="flow-text">We found that students:</p>

			    <ul class="collection">
			      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Lacked peer networks – people don’t talk to each other.</li>
			      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Represented a variety of age groups.</li>
			      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Lacked internet and/or technological knowledge.</li>
			      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Lived far from their respective institutions.</li>
			      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Have different educational levels and backgrounds.</li>
			      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Needed to choose own engagement levels.</li>
			    </ul>

    			<p class="flow-text">We also identified that online/remote/northern students are often unaware of existing academic resources that can help ease the learning process, as well they did not have a strong support network of friends, peers, or professors.</p>

    			<div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    			<h3>Problem Framing and Opportunity</h3>	

    			<p class="flow-text">Based on these findings, we found that there was an opportunity to optimize and streamline the academic resources available to online learners, and provide chances for structured collaboration between peers.</p>

    			<blockquote>
    				<p class="middle-align xxx-large-text">

    				How might we create value in tools and resources designed for academic success (available online or through institutions) and guide Northern and remote online learners towards them?</p>
    			</blockquote>

                <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
                <h3>Design Principles</h3>
                <p class="flow-text">For our MVP, we narrowed our solution to focus on these principles:</p>
                <ul class="flow-text">
                <li><b>• Enables collaboration and community</b></li>
                <li><b>• Creates value in online educational resources</b></li>
                <li><b>• Choose your own level of engagement</b></li>
                <li><b>• Builds professional and casual relationships</b></li>
                </ul>

                <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
                <h3>Curating Education Resources</h3>
                <p class="flow-text">For our prototype we wanted to create a platform where students can share resources and also connect people. We want to allow students to gather, curate and share relevant articles and resources, while creating meaningful connections with peers.</h2>

      			</div>

      			<div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
                <h3>Project Pivot</h3>
                <p class="flow-text">Five months into our project we merge our team to support another team as there were a lot of overlaps within user research as well as design solutions between the two projects. This meant the end for the Northern and remote project stream, so we were not able to create an MVP or validate our prototype. Similarities in user research found that both groups of students had experienced isolation and conflicting identities, encountered barriers that made it more challenging to break cycles, and lacked general experiences within post-secondary education.</p>

                <p class="flow-text">For the new project stream, instead of targeting the solution towards just Northern and remote students, we saw the new combined target demographic as underrepresented students. The new solution looked at helping students form meaningful connections with others to feel connected to their learning experience, as well as sharing experiences through connections in the form of mentorship, person to person learning, and role models.</p>

                    <h3>What I learned</h3>
                    <p class="flow-text">Working together with three other diverse students opened up a variety of different solutions and perspectives. This was also a great learning and teaching opportunity to hone each others crafts and share our wisdom for an open education project. There were a lot of design principles and processes I got to share and communicate to the team. By understanding and sharing our strengths and how it plays into the job roles, their intersections, and values, that is when you will end up with a well thought out product.

    				<p class="flow-text">The <a href="https://sxdlab.ecampusontario.ca/">SXD Lab</a> is a student innovation lab tasked with solving complex post-secondary problems using design methodologies. The problems and opportunities that we focus on are often wrapped up in a system that requires a lot of unpacking, user research, and a variety of interventions. The goal of the projects is to create change – in the way the system operates, and the way it works with students.</p>
