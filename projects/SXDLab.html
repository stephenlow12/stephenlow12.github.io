    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">The SXD Lab is an Ontario innovation hub that tackles some of the most complex problems facing post-secondary education. I'm currently working on the Northern and Remote project stream, to reimagine how to better prepare Northern and remote learners for online learning.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="subheader">Background</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">The Northern and Remote project is looking to enhance the post-secondary educational journey for northern and remote online learners. Students who choose to study online are faced with unique academic challenges that they often have to overcome on an individual basis. The Northern and Remote team was tasked with combatting one of the common learning barriers faced by online learners and provide an innovative solution that can help guide students towards achieving their academic goals. Using inclusive design processes, the solution will aim to create value in tools designed for academic success and encourage collaboration amongst peers.
    </p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Challenge</h2>
      <p class="flow-text">Research conducted by the Northern and Remote team during the initial design phase has identified the demographic of online and remote learners across Ontario. With 12,728 online courses, 809 online programs, and 360,000 students, 29% of all postsecondary students in Ontario are online learners.</p>

      <p class="flow-text">Despite being remote to their respective universities and colleges, their responsibilities, be it work or family, also kept them at home. Online learning provides these individuals with the opportunity to reach their academic goals, and allows them the flexibility needed for their busy lives. Based on our findings, there is an opportunity to optimize and streamline the academic resources available to online learners, and provide chances for structured collaboration between peers.

    <h2 class="subheader">User Research Process</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">We conducted user research, targeting our recruitment towards students from northern and remote communities. Through a dozen interviews, a survey, and journey maps that laid out their first year of online learning from discovery to completion, we were able to identify barriers and insights and recognize common themes amongst online learners. Specifically, they:</p>

    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Lack peer networks – people don’t talk to each other.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Represent a variety of age groups.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Lack internet and/or technological knowledge.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Live far from their respective institutions.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Have different educational levels and backgrounds.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Need to choose own engagement levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="flow-text">We also identified that online/remote/northern students are often unaware of existing academic resources that can help ease the learning process. They also don’t have a support network. Based on these findings, there is an opportunity to optimize and streamline the academic resources available to online learners, and provide chances for structured collaboration between peers.</p>

    <div class="small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Current State</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">We are currently working on a prototype to fuel collaboration amongst online learners, enabling them to share resources, experiences, and other pertinent knowledge. While some students seek an individual educational journey, others wish they had better communication with their school and peers. Our prototype tool will increase the students’ knowledge of academic resources, help them to establish peer networks, and give them the ability to take charge of their own success and feel confident about their education.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">The Lab</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">The <a href="https://sxdlab.ecampusontario.ca/">SXD Lab</a> is a student innovation lab tasked with solving complex post-secondary problems using design methodologies. The problems and opportunities that we focus on are often wrapped up in a system that requires a lot of unpacking, user research, and a variety of interventions. The goal of the projects is to create change – in the way the system operates, and the way it works with students.</p>
