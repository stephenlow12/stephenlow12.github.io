    </blockquote>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">I joined the AIR MILES Business Transformation team, reporting to the AD of User Experience, and also got to work closely with the User Research team. I was curious to see how the team here designed their AIR MILES product portfolio to cater to 11 million collectors, in an increasingly competitive loyalty market.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="subheader">The Challenges</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">Since my team was under shared services, I was able to work on a variety of different projects. I learned a lot about the different design and research processes available, and when it was appropriate to use each process. In terms of products, I got to conceptualize a new Chat Landing page, in place of the <a href="https://www.airmiles.ca/arrow/ChatLandingOpenPage">outdated</a> one. I also got to conceptualize the redesign for CELO Green, the software used on every call by our customer agents.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">Under the UX Research team, I had the opportunity to recruit, moderate, and conduct, user research sessions with both internal stakeholders, as well as our collectors. I looked at opportunities to improve the Offers workstream, and offer collectors a better omni-channel experience, synthesized the data for the navigation of the upcoming AIR MILES site relaunch, and looked at the best way to present <a href="https://airmiles.ca/perks">Perks</a> for our collectors. I also helped with the user research and synthesize the findings for our national promotion, <a href="https://shoptheblock.ca">Shop the Block</a>, looking for opportunities to improve the mobile and desktop micro-site experience.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">As a side project I designed this funky poster, to help guide our internal stakeholders during user testing viewing sessions:</p>

    <div class="small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Chat Landing Page</h2>
    <p class="flow-text"> One of the many projects I got to work on was for the Chat Landing page. Not only was it outdated, but due to a change in one of our redemption processes, the page had to redirect users to our vendor's support page to complete a certain type of redemption. The high-level goals were to:</p>


    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Direct users to the correct vendor support pages.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Promote use of self-serve options before starting a live chat/call.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Not hinder or make it difficult for users to start a live chat.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Follow the current AIR MILES pattern library and branding guidelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <center><img class="responsive-img" src="../img/old-chat-landing.PNG" style="width: 750px;"></center>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Initial Research</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">Through the UX Research team, we found that a majority of tickets to our call centre are for PIN resets, card replacements, and email changes. All of these issues can be resolved fairly quickly with our self-serve tool. Though the chat page currently has links to the tool, it is hidden behind a mouse scrollover, and also doesn't prompt with relevant and highly visible FAQs.</p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Potential Solutions</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">These tools should be easily accessible to proactively solve our collectors' issues, prior to them needing to open a chat. Since we released <a href="https://m.me/AirmilesMyles" target="_blank">Myles the FAQ Chatbot</a> earlier this year, it would be ideal to introduce this feature to our collectors on this page as well. Myles can help guide them through their self-serve journey, or steer them towards knowledge articles, without the hassle of a chat or call.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">Another feature to consider is the call-to-action button that opens the chat. There are currently six "Chat Now" CTA buttons, which might overwhelm someone looking to just change their PIN. This goes hand-in-hand with the wording of the self-serve copy as well. Phrases like “How do I …” that don’t relate to the specific task, makes it more frustrating to scan for the one solution relevant to them.

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Design Solution</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">I wanted to explore solutions that would provide a familiar design pattern to the users by eliminating jargon and simplifying the layout:</p>

    <div class="row"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <img class="materialboxed hoverable" style="float: left; padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/chat-ideation-1.png">
        <img class="materialboxed hoverable" style="padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/chat-ideation-2.png">
      </div>

    <div class="row"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <img class="materialboxed hoverable" style="float: left; padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/chat-ideation-3.png">
        <img class="materialboxed hoverable" style="padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/chat-ideation-4.png">
      </div>

    <div class="row"></div>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">High Fidelity</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">Focused on incorporating the AIR MILES pattern library and brand identity:</p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <center><img class="responsive-img z-depth-3" src="../img/chat-hi-fi.png" style="width: 100%;"></center>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Key Learnings</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">I was able to learn a lot about the processes involved in design, from the initial discovery phases, all the way to a product launch. Since my team was a shared-service, I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects from Design Systems, to data mining phrases for our Chatbot. Holistic View of the Product Design Process  I can confidently say that I understand the foundations of how a loyalty program works, and the challenges they face.</p>
