    </blockquote>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">I joined the AIR MILES Business Transformation team, reporting to the AD of User Experience, and also got to work closely with the User Research team. I was curious to see how the team here designed their AIR MILES product portfolio to cater to 11 million collectors, in an increasingly competitive loyalty market.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">The Challenge(s)</h2>
    <p class="flow-text"> Since my team was under shared services, I was able to work on a variety of different projects. I learned a lot about the different design and research processes available, and when to use which process. In terms of products, I got to conceptualize a new Chat Landing page, to replace the <a href="https://www.airmiles.ca/arrow/ChatLandingOpenPage">outdated</a> one. This page also had to direct collectors to the appropriate vendor support pages, due to a new method of redemption with our partners.</p>

    <p class="flow-text"> Under the UX Research team, I had the oppurtunity to recruit, moderate, and conduct, user research sessions with both internal stakeholders, as well as our collectors. We looked at ways to improve the Offers workstream, through giving our collectors a better onmi-channel experience.</p>

    <p class="flow-text"> I also got to work on the user research and synthesis for our national promo, <a href="https://shoptheblock.ca">Shop the Block</a>, looking for oppurtunities to improve the mobile and desktop micro-site experience. As a side project I got to design this <a href="#">funky poster</a> to help guide stakeholders in our viewing rooms during user-testing sessions.</p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Chat Landing Page </h2>
    <p class="flow-text"> The current Chat Landing page needed an overhaul, as not only was it outdated, but had to redirect users looking for a certain support page to an exteneral support page. The high level goals were to:</p>


    <ol class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">Direct users to the correct vendor support pages.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">Promote use of self-serve options before starting a live chat/call.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">Not hinder or make it difficult for users to start a live chat.</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">Follow the current AIR MILES pattern library and branding guidelines.</li>
    </ol>
