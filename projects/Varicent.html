    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">At RBC I worked on the Client Acquisition and Digital Sales team, under the <i>I Want to Choose a Bank</i> customer journey. I worked on a cross-disciplinary team that focused on building and delivery tools for the client account opening experience that occurs between advisors and clients. This team was made up of varying combinations of developers, designers, and product owners.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="subheader">Background</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">I worked alongside a senior interaction designer on the end-to-end design of the “Banking Reinvention” project. This involved designing a tool to support a new chequing product line, a new value program, and designing for a modified version of the current client account opening experience.</p>

    <p class="flow-text">The main work within the Banking Reinvention project stream was the The Needs Assessment Tool. This tool is used to support product discovery conversations between advisors and clients, and to aid them in finding the right chequing account suitable for them. Aswell, this tool had to communicate a new product shelf, as well as an accompanying value program that accounted for depth of engagement with RBC products.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">Problem Framing</h2>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Auditing Current Assessment Tools</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">To gain a better understanding of the current assessment tools that adivsors used, we audited some of the client-facing ‘wizard’ tools that was available through RBC. These tools ranged from account selectors currently used by advisors, to self-serve credit card recommendation tools.</p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    
    <h3 class="subheader">We Believe That Advisors and Clients Have a Problem:</h3>

    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Outputting real-time feedback at any point during the account opening flow</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Providing transparent recommendations</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Evaluating a client’s multi-product needs</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Understanding future needs</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Our Goal and Focus For This Tool Is To:</h3>
    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Produce an output with minimum inputs to support a range of discovery conversations</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Be called upon when necessary</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Rationalize making multi-product recommendation so clients feel confident</li>
      <li class="collection-item flow-text">• Support conversations beyond the client’s immediate needs and understand future value</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subheader">Wireframing to Paper Prototyping</h3>

    <div class="row"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <img style="float: left; padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/rbc/wireframing2.jpg">
        <img style="padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/rbc/wireframing1.jpg">
      </div>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>
    
 	<p class="flow-text">The wireframes were transitioned to paper prototypes so we could easily and rapidly communicate our thinking to not just our team, but also stakeholders. This process is helpful to consider what steps in the journey the user will take, and along with that, what components, elements, and even animation schemes might be possible.</p>

    <div class="row"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <img style="float: left; padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/rbc/video-prototyping.gif">
        <img style="padding:1.5% !important" width="50%" src="../img/rbc/paper-prototype.png">
        
      </div>    

    <p class="flow-text">These paper prototypes were used as artifacts for our first round of user interviews with advisors. We discovered that there wasn’t an optimal set of questions that advisors might have used to make a recommendation. We also learned that every conversation between an advisor and a client is different, so by steering the questions, this took away from the genuine and organic conversations that naturally occur and even made the process seem robotic to some advisors.</p>

    <div class="row"></div>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Prototyping</h3>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <p class="flow-text">During our second round of testing with our prototype (below), we were looking at concept testing. This was the first time the advisors seen this product but the general feedback was overall receptive, pointing to the easy disection of the account features and the overage fees. We also brought back feedback on the focus and heirachy of the design, and advisors "Not knowing where to start" as well as feeling overwhelmed with the design on first sight.</p>

    <center><img style="padding:1.5% !important" width="70%" src="../img/rbc/low-fi.png"></center>

    <p class="flow-text">Second version of the prototype looked to solve for some of the feedback advisors brought up during the inital version.</p>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Final MVP Prototype</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">From the lower fidelity prototypes, our visual designer and content designer helped refine those along with a third round of user interviews with advisors to conclude with the following prototype.</p>

    <center><img style="padding:1.5% !important" width="70%" src="../img/rbc/hi-fi1.png"></center>
    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h3 class="subheader">Microinteractions</h3>

    <p class="flow-text">As the tool had many states, it was important to use animations to enhance and support the user experience of the tool. I used Framer to prototype the animations.</p>

    <div class="row"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <img style="float: left; padding:1.5% !important" width="33%" src="../img/rbc/recommended card.gif">
        <img style="padding:1.5% !important" width="33%" src="../img/rbc/recommended tag.gif">
        <img style="padding:1.5% !important" width="33%" src="../img/rbc/button animate.gif">
      </div>

    <div class="x-small-spacer"></div>

    <h2 class="subheader">Key Learnings</h2>
    <p class="flow-text">Working end-to-end on this product shed light on the process, which like the various assessment tools ― is not linear. There were many areas of this project where we had to backlog both design and research decisions to meet the October launch deadline. This was my first time working on an embedded team with developers and the product team, which definately sped up both the design and development process, as well as helped us manage the work in small increments that aligned with the user testing. There were some external factors beyond our team's control that influenced a few of the design decisions, which surfaced from out inital prototype. It was so important to loop in these stakeholders throughout the process, and update them on both the design and research checkpoints to align the vision together as a team. A party we should have looped in earlier on design process was the accessibility team, as they pointed out some potential naviagational issues in the layout, which could have been addressed if we had consulted with them earlier.</p>
